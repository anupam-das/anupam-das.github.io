<h2>Openings</h2>

<p>
I'm looking for motivated and energetic students to work together on problems in security and privacy. Prior experience in security or privacy is not mandatory. However, candidates should be eager to learn and explore new things. Experience in other areas including HCI, machine learning, systems, signal processing, ubiquitous computing and theory is a plus. If you are interested, you can Email me.
 
NCSU is a public research university (R1) located in beautiful Raleigh at North Carolina. It is a part of the well-known research triangle (NCSU, Duke and UNC). The region's growing high-technology community includes companies such as IBM, SAS Institute, Cisco Systems, NetApp, Red Hat, EMC Corporation; so a lot of internship opportunities. CS@NCSU is ranked 43rd in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings/page+2">USNews</a> and 28th in security and cryptography category at <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?sec&crypt">csrankings.org</a>. So consider applying to NCSU!
