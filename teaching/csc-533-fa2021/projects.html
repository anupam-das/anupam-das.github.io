			<p>The various project assignments are designed to make sure you make proper progress on your class projects. 
			These assignments will enable you to obtain early feedback on your ongoing work. 
			All project-related assignments will be graded within one to two weeks if they are submitted on time. 
			No late assignments will be accepted, except for legitimate reasons. 
			Students may also submit these assignments early for early feedback.</p>
	
			<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

			<h4 id="submission">Submission Format</h4>
			<p><strong>One submission per group</strong>. After title provide all the team member names and unity IDs.
			Submission should be in PDF. Final report should contain link to GitHub or Google drive for relevant code and data.</p>

			<b>Use Latex with font size 11pt and single space. The final report should be around 8 pages excluding references (<strong>progress report can be shorter</strong>). Use the ACM Latex style file available here <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-master.zip">ACM_LATEX</a></b>. Use the <b>sample-sigconf.tex</b> sample and change the font size to 11pt <i>[\documentclass[sigconf,11pt]{acmart}]</i>. <b>Submissions not following this format will be penalized</b>.<br><br>
			
			<h4 id="proposal">Project Selection</h4>
			
			<p>You are expected to either submit your own project idea (i.e., a small paragraph describing the problem you want to work on). Please submit two to three ideas.
			You can propose to work in groups of two to three students.</p>
			
			<h4 id="proposal">Project Proposal</h4>
			
			<p>Please submit a description of the project you intend to complete. 
			If you want early feedback or help deciding between a few projects, 
			please discuss with the instructor. Only one submission per group is required. 
			The proposal should be <b>no more than three pages</b>.
			</p>

			<p>The project proposal should include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Title</li>
				<li>Names and email addresses of all team members</li>
				<li>Problem statement (Clearly state what problem you are investigating -- should be about 1 to 3 paragraphs)</li>
				<li>Background and motivation (why is this an interesting and important problem -- should be about 1 to 3 paragraph)</li>
				<li>Literature review or related work section. This section should highlight the state-of-the-art situation regarding the problem you are tackling. This will also help better highlight the contribution(s) of your proposed project</li>
				<li>Proposed approach (how do you plan to conduct your research, what techniques to use)</li>
				<li>Initial evaluation plan (things can change later but need to have the basic criteria for evaluation)</li>
				<li>Milestones. Explain in a few sentences what steps you will take and the time frame in which you expect to complete each step; for a team project also indicate who will work on what.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>In preparing the proposal you should conduct a literature review so that you are aware of what other work has already been done in this area and how your work further contributes to the area. The project proposal is intended to help you better organize your thoughts about how to best proceed with the semester project and communicate them to your instructor. You will receive feedback on your proposal that may result in some changes to your project plans.</p>
			
			<p>Writing quality (grammar, spelling, clarity, etc.) will be considered in grading reports.</p>

			<p>Please submit your project proposal in PDF format. Only one submission per group is required.</p>

			<h4 id="presentations">Project Discussion/Final Presentation Format</h4>
			<p>You will get 10-15 minutes to present your ongoing project work. 
			Project presentation is an opportunity for you (and your team) to get early feedback on your ongoing work. 
			To ensure you make the best use of this opportunity, please outline your presentation to 
			include the following items (this is a rough outline, so feel free to modify as you see fit):</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Motivation for the project and problem statement</li>
				<li>Brief background</li>
				<li>Proposed approach</li>
				<li>Study/Experiment design</li>
				<li>Evaluation and findings (initial findings for project discussion)</li>
				<li>Summary of findings (for final presentation)</li>
				<li>Discussion (for final presentation open the floor for discussion)</li>
				<li>Limitations and future work (for final presentation)</li>

			<h4 id="report">Final Report</h4>
			<p>Your project report should document all the work you have done on your project. 
			It should include a detailed literature review and motivation for your project. 
			If you have developed software or created something as part of the project, 
			please provide screen shots, a link to a demo, and source code for review as well (preferably in github). 
			The report should include descriptions of what obstacles you encountered, 
			how you carried out data collection and evaluation, etc., as appropriate. 
			Please consult with the instructor about what should be included in your report if you have any doubts.</p>

			

			<p>Here are some things we will be looking for in most papers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Well-structured paper with appropriate sections. A typical research paper has the following sections: 
				introduction, background and motivation, related work, experimental design (includes data collection methodology, 
				experimental setup, systems design), evaluation and results, conclusion and discussion (including limitations and 
				future work).</li>
				<li>For projects that involve surveys or experiments or large-scale data collection, provide details of the experimental 
				designs and proper rationale behind such designs.</li>
				<li>Clearly state the analytic techniques (statistical, theoretical, machine learning etc.) and metrics you used to evaluate your findings.</li>
				<li>Clearly convey takeaways from experimental results and conclusions that are well supported by the rest of your paper. Reading your paper we should have a clear idea of how your work contributes to the field of privacy.</li>
				<li>Properly formatted bibliography with an appropriate number of references (most projects should have at least 10 references; references can include online media sources, and conference or journal papers).</li>
				<li>Paper that has been spell checked and proof read. If English is not your native language, please request a friend to help you proof-read your final paper before you submit it. Also, take advantage of word processors with spell checkers and grammar checkers. There are also writing centers on campus with tutors who can assist you.</li>
				<li>Well formatted paper (adequate margins and spacing, proper font size, clear figures with appropriate captions, etc.).</li>
				<li><bf> For group project a separate section highlighting who did what portion of the tasks.<bf></li>
			</ul>
	
			<p>Please submit your final paper in PDF format. Only one submission per group is required.</p>
