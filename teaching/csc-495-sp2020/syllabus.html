			<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>	
			
				<p>Privacy is a growing concern in our modern society. 
				We interact and share our personal information with a wide variety of organizations, including financial and healthcare institutions, web service providers and social networks. Many times such personal information is inappropriately collected, used or shared, often without our awareness. 
				This course introduces privacy in a broad sense, with the aim of providing students an overview of the challenging and emerging research topics in privacy.<p> 

				<p>This course will expose students to many of the issues that privacy engineers, program managers, researchers and designers deal with in industry. By the end of the course, students will learn about the following areas in privacy:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Data privacy: the motivations for data privacy and common implementations (e.g., k-anonymity, differential privacy, information flow).</li>
					<li>Online privacy: online tracking and anonymous communication systems.</li>
					<li>Opportunities and implications of using AI/ML in privacy.</li>
					<li>Side-channel threats.</li>
					<li>Privacy acts: privacy regulations, frameworks and compliance/auditing tools.</li>
					<li>Usable privacy: perceptions of privacy, privacy attitudes, privacy preferences.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>REG 02.50.03 (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">Grades and
					Grade Point Average</a>) describes the grade point interpretation of
				letter grades.</p>
			
			<h5 id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments</h5>

				<p>The instructor will assign homework on a
				periodic basis for topics associated with the class syllabus. These
				homeworks require the students to write, program, or perform other basic
				research. The content and due dates of these assignments will be decided over
				the course of the semester. If you cannot attend a lecture, contact fellow
				students to see if any assignments have been published or revisit the course schedule page <a href="/teaching/csc-495-sp2020/schedule.html">Schedule</a>. The lowest graded assignment will be dropped.</p>


			<h5 id="mideterm-exam">Exams</h5>		

				<p>Exams will be scheduled covering topics until the exam date. The exam will be a closed book exam, usaully lasting one hour. Question format will be discussed in class. The exact date of the exam will be provided in the <a href="/teaching/csc-495-sp2020/schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</p>

			<!--
			<h4 id="class-project">Class Project</h4>
				<p>The class project will require students to conduct researches relate to the course material.
				Students may opt to work solely or in groups of two or three depending on the scope of the project.
				Students can suggest their own projects or choose one from <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
				<b>The main objective of the project is to provide students with hands-on experience with real-world privacy problems.</b>
				Some projects will involve analyzing user data, while others may involve developing a system to collect and analyze real-world system data.
				High quality works will potentially lead to conference/workshop papers. Students will be expected to submit a project report 
				(8-10 pages) before the end of the semester.</p>
			-->

			<!--
			<h4 id="weekly-reading">Weekly reading</h4>			
				<p>Students will be asked to read one or two scholarly articles (e.g., research papers) every week and submit one page of review. Students will be asked to submit such reviews online. Students will be given the flexibility to miss review submission for at most one week.</p>
			-->

			<h5 id="class-quiz">Pop Quizzes</h5>	

				<p>Pop quizzes will be held at the end of certain classes and will cover topics from that day's class lecture. <b>Please bring any computing 				device (e.g., laptop or phone) with you as some of these quizzes will be electronically posted</b>. It is strongly encouraged that students be attentive during class. Quizzes missed because of absences cannot be made up unless arrangements are made with the instructor prior to the course meeting. Only a handful of pop quizzes will be held and the lowest graded pop quiz will be dropped.</p>
				
			<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h3>

				<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete 
				grade will automatically change to an 'F' after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which 
				the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student 
				is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to 'F' will count as an attempted course 
				on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. 
				The university policy on incomplete grades is located at <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3</a>.	
			
			<h3 id="weekly-course-schedule">Weekly Course Schedule</h3>

				<p>See the course <a href="/teaching/csc-495-sp2020/schedule.html">schedule</a>. Note that
				the schedule is subject to change as the semester evolves.</p>	
							
			<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>

				<p>No late assignments will be accepted. Students with legitimate reasons who contact the professor before the deadline may apply for an extension.</p>

			<h3 id="regrade-policy">Regrade Policy</h3>

				<p>No regrading requests will be honored after two weeks of releasing the grade for any assignment/report/porject. If you see any issues with the grading, please contact the instructor within two weeks of releasing the grade. For final grades the time frame is only one week.</p>
		
			<h3 id="communications-policy">Communications Policy</h3>

				<p>Announcements and online class discussion will occur via <a href="https://piazza.com/class/spring2020/csc495002/home">Piazza</a>. 
				It is the responsibility of the student to sign up
				for an account. Questions to the instructor or TA should occur in Piazza unless
				there is a reason not to. The instructor or the TA will do their best to
				respond to questions in Piazza within 24 hours. When appropriate, make the
				question viewable to everyone so that the answer can benefit all students. For
				sensitive matters (e.g., grading), email the instructor and/or TA. Whenever
				emailing the TA about grading concerns, please CC the instructor.</p>
				
				
			<h3 id="electronically-hosted-course-components">Electronically-Hosted Course Components</h3>

				<p>Students may be required to disclose personally identifiable information to other students in the course. 
				Examples include online discussions of class topics, and posting of student coursework. 
				All students are expected to respect the privacy of each other by not sharing or using such information outside the course.</p>
		
		
			<h3 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h3>
				<p>The instructor will not take any formal attendance for class meetings.
				However, as stated above, a portion of the grade is based on class participation, which includes pop quizzes. 
				Additionally, exam material includes anything in the readings, slides, and topics discussed in
				class. Students missing class should consult classmates for missed material.</p>

				<p>The university policy on excused absences will be observed (see <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03</a>).
				The students are responsible for discussing makeup exams if they miss
				exams due to excused absence. The instructor will choose a mutually
				agreed date and time for the makeup exam. Late submission of homework
				assignments due to excused absences is not subject to the policies on
				late assignments.</p>

			<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>

				<p>
				The university, college, and department policies against academic
				dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You may obtain copies of the NCSU
				Code of Student Conduct from the Office of Student Conduct, or from the
				following URL: <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
				The instructor expects honesty in the completion of test and
				assignments. The instructor has a zero-tolerance policy for violations
				of academic integrity. The instructor carefully monitors for instances
				of offenses such as plagiarism and illegal collaboration, so it is very
				important that students use their best possible judgement in meeting
				this policy. The instructor will not entertain any discussion on the
				discovery of an offense, and will assign the 'F' grade and refer the
				student to the appropriate University bodies for possible further
				action. It is the understanding and expectation of instructor that
				the student's signature on any test or assignment means that the student
				neither gave nor received unauthorized aid.
				For additional information, visit <a href="http://studentconduct.ncsu.edu/">http://studentconduct.ncsu.edu/</a>
				</p>

				<p>Note that students are explicitly forbidden to copy anything off the
				Internet (e.g., source code, text) for the purposes of completing an
				assignment or the final project. Also, students are forbidden from
				collaborating on any assignment except were explicitly
				allowed in writing by the instructor.
				</p>

			<h3 id="ethics-statement">Ethics Statement</h3>

				<p>
				This course considers topics involving personal and public privacy and
				security. As part of this investigation we will cover technologies
				whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an instructor, I
				rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use may
				include circumvention of existing security or privacy measurements for
				any purpose, or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of
				vulnerabilities of these services.  Exceptions to these guidelines
				<em>may</em> occur in the process of reporting vulnerabilities through
				public and authoritative channels. Any activity outside the letter or spirit
				of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may
				result in dismissal from the class. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM code of ethics and professional 				conduct</a> for more details.
				</p>

				<p>
				When in doubt, please contact the course professor for advice.  <b>Do
				not</b> undertake any action which could be perceived as technology
				misuse anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have
				received explicit permission from the instructor.
				</p>
