			<h3 id="course-prerequisites">Course Prerequisites</h3>

				<p><b>Prerequisites</b>: CSC 316 (ST 370 is recommended)<br>
				<b>Informal:</b> You need to have some understanding on (1) basic concepts on statistics and probability and (2) basics of systems implementation (e.g., web, distributed systems,
				networking, etc.). <strong>If you do not have a basic understanding of these
				areas, you may have difficulty with certain parts of the course.</strong> If you have questions
				regarding these prerequisites, please contact the instructor.</p>

			<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>	
			
				<p>Privacy is a growing concern in our modern society. We interact and share our personal information with a wide variety of organizations, including financial and healthcare institutions, web service providers and social networks. Many times such personal information is inappropriately collected, used or shared, often without our awareness. This course introduces privacy in a broad sense to provide students an overview of the challenging and emerging research topics in privacy.<p> 

				<p>This course will expose students to many of the issues that privacy engineers, program managers, researchers and designers deal with in the industry. By the end of the course, students will learn about the following areas in privacy:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Data privacy: the motivations for data privacy and common implementations (e.g., k-anonymity, differential privacy).</li>
					<li>Online privacy: online tracking and anonymous communication systems.</li>
					<li>Opportunities and implications of using AI/ML in privacy.</li>
					<li>Side-channel threats: Emerging side-channel attacks.</li>
					<li>Privacy acts: privacy regulations, frameworks and compliance/auditing tools.</li>
					<li>Usable privacy: perceptions of privacy, privacy attitudes, privacy preferences.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>REG 02.50.03 (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">Grades and
					Grade Point Average</a>) describes the grade point interpretation of
				letter grades.</p>
			
			<h5 id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments</h5>

				<p>The instructor will assign homework on a
				periodic basis for topics associated with the class syllabus. These
				homework assignments require the students to write, program, or perform other basic
				research. The content and due dates of these assignments will be decided over
				the course of the semester (usually giving around 2 weeks per assignment). If you cannot attend a lecture, contact fellow students to see if any assignments have been published or revisit the course assignment page <a href="/teaching/csc-433-sp2023/assignment.html">Assignment</a>. The <strong>lowest graded assignment will be dropped</strong>. Assignments will posted and collected through Moodle.</p>


			<h5 id="mideterm-exam">Exams</h5>		

				<p>Exams will be scheduled covering topics until the exam date. The exam will last around one to two hours. Question format will be discussed in class. The exact date of the exam will be provided in the <a href="/teaching/csc-433-sp2023/schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</p>

			
			<h5 id="class-project">Class Project</h5>
				<p>The class project will require students to conduct research related to the course material.
				Students will work in groups of two or three depending on the scope of the project.
				<!--Students can suggest their own projects or choose one from <a href="projects.html">here</a>.-->
				Students are encouraged to propose their own projects.
				<b>The main objective of the project is to provide students with hands-on experience with real-world privacy problems.</b>
				Some projects will involve analyzing user data, while others may involve developing a system to collect and analyze real-world system data. High quality works will potentially lead to conference/workshop papers. Students will be expected to submit a midterm project report and a short presentation before the end of the semester.</p>
		

			<!--
			<h4 id="weekly-reading">Weekly reading</h4>			
				<p>Students will be asked to read one or two scholarly articles (e.g., research papers) every week and submit one page of review. Students will be asked to submit such reviews online. Students will be given the flexibility to miss review submission for at most one week.</p>
			-->

			<!--
			<h5 id="class-quiz">Pop Quizzes</h5>	

				<p>Pop quizzes will be held at the end of certain classes and will cover topics from that day's class lecture. <b>Please bring any computing 				device (e.g., laptop or phone) with you as some of these quizzes will be electronically posted</b>. It is strongly encouraged that students be attentive during class. Quizzes missed because of absences cannot be made up unless arrangements are made with the instructor prior to the course meeting. Only a handful of pop quizzes will be held and the lowest graded pop quiz will be dropped.</p>
			-->
				
		
			
			<h3 id="weekly-course-schedule">Weekly Course Schedule</h3>

				<p>See the course <a href="/teaching/csc-433-sp2023/schedule.html">schedule</a>. Note that
				the schedule is subject to change as the semester evolves.</p>	

			
							
			<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>

				<p><strong>No late assignments will be accepted</strong>. Students with legitimate reasons who contact the instructor before the deadline may be granted an extension.</p>

			<h3 id="regrade-policy">Re-grade Policy</h3>

				<p>No re-grading requests will be honored after one weeks of releasing the grade for any assignment/report/project. If you see any issues with the grading, please contact the instructor/TA within one weeks of releasing the grade.</p>


			<h3 id="incomplete-policy">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h3>

				<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete 
				grade will automatically change to an 'F' after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which 
				the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student 
				is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to 'F' will count as an attempted course 
				on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. 
				The university policy on incomplete grades is located at <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3</a>.	

			<!--
				<p>If the delivery mode has a negative impact on your academic performance in this course, the university has provided tools to potentially reduce the impact:  
				<ul>
					<li> <a href="https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-sat-grading/">Enhanced S/U Grading Option</a></li>
					<li> <a href="https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-latedrop/">Late Drop</a></li>
				</ul>  
				In some cases, another option may be to request an incomplete in the course.  Before using any of these tools, discuss the options with your instructor and your academic advisor.  Be aware that if you use the enhanced S/U, you will still need to complete the course and receive at least a C- to pass the course. 
				</p>
			-->
		
			<h3 id="communications-policy">Communications Policy</h3>

				<p>Announcements and online class discussion will occur via <a href="https://piazza.com/ncsu/spring2023/csc433/home">Piazza</a>. 
				It is the responsibility of the student to sign up
				for an account. Questions to the instructor or TA should occur in Piazza unless
				there is a reason not to. The instructor or the TA will do their best to
				respond to questions in Piazza within 24 hours. When appropriate, make the
				question viewable to everyone so that the answer can benefit all students. For
				sensitive matters (e.g., grading), email the instructor and/or TA. Whenever
				emailing the TA about grading concerns, please CC the instructor.</p>


				<p>Students should be aware that their behavior impacts other people, even online. I hope that we will all strive to develop a positive and supportive environment and will be courteous to fellow students and your instructor. Due to the nature of the online environment, there are some things to remember when taking an online course and engaging with others. </p>

				Tips for Success:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Do:</strong> Follow the same standards of behavior that you subscribe to offline.  Keep in mind that all online communication is documented and therefore permanent. </li>

					<li><strong>Don't</strong>: Flame others in discussion forums. Flaming is the act of responding in a highly critical, sarcastic, or ridiculing manner – especially if done on a personal level.  Remember that these discussions are meant for constructive exchanges and learning!</li>
				 
					<li><strong>Do</strong>: Ensure you are responding to forums by the due date, in order to leave time for peers to comment on your response. </li>

					<li><strong>Don't</strong>: Go for long periods of time without communicating to your instructors or classmates. It is important to stay a part of the online community!</li>
				 
					<li><strong>Do</strong>:  Remember to read over your posts before selecting "Submit."</li>

					<li><strong>Don't</strong>: Use slang, poor grammar, and other informal language in discussion forums or email messages to instructors or classmates.</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h3 id="panopto-policy">Video Recording Policy</h3>
				<p>The class lectures will be recorded to be viewed by students who are unable to attend. By taking this course, you agree for your video and audio to be recorded and shared with other students taking this course this semester. However, student faces will not be intentionally captured rather audio stream will be captured during class discussions.</p>
			
				
				
			<h3 id="electronically-hosted-course-components">Electronically-Hosted Course Components</h3>
				<p>Students may be required to disclose personally identifiable information to other students in the course, via digital tools, such as email or web-postings, where relevant to the course (e.g., Piazza). Examples include online discussions of class topics, and posting of student coursework. All students are expected to respect the privacy of each other by not sharing or using such information outside the course.</p>

		
			<h3 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h3>
				<p>The instructor will not take any formal attendance for class meetings. However, students are advised to attend the class for discussion and presentations. 
				<!--Students can asynchronously view class lecture videos offline due to health concerns arising from the novel coronavirus or other legitimate concerns. -->
				<!--However, as stated above, a portion of the grade is based on class participation, which includes pop quizzes. -->
				</p>

				<p>The university policy on excused absences will be observed (see <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03</a>).
				The students are responsible for discussing makeup exams if they miss
				exams due to excused absence. The instructor will choose a mutually
				agreed date and time for the makeup exam. Late submission of homework
				assignments due to excused absences is not subject to the policies on
				late assignments.</p>


			<!--<h3 id="statement-course-continuity">Academic Continuity</h3>

				<p>
				In the event of any unforeseen circumstances (e.g., limited campus activity due to novel coronavirus), there will be opportunity to continue academic actively remotely, thus respecting absences and quarantine scenarios. Please reach-out to the instructor for more details, if such circumstances arise. 
				</p>
			-->


			<h3 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h3>

				<p>
				The university, college, and department policies against academic
				dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You may obtain copies of the NCSU
				Code of Student Conduct from the Office of Student Conduct, or from the
				following URL: <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
				The instructor expects honesty in the completion of test and
				assignments. The instructor has a zero-tolerance policy for violations
				of academic integrity. The instructor carefully monitors for instances
				of offenses such as plagiarism and illegal collaboration, so it is very
				important that students use their best possible judgement in meeting
				this policy. The instructor will not entertain any discussion on the
				discovery of an offense, and will assign the 'F' grade and refer the
				student to the appropriate University bodies for possible further
				action. It is the understanding and expectation of the instructor that
				the student's signature on any test or assignment means that the student
				neither gave nor received unauthorized aid.
				For additional information, visit <a href="http://studentconduct.ncsu.edu/">http://studentconduct.ncsu.edu/</a>
				</p>

				<p>Note that students are explicitly forbidden to copy anything off the
				Internet (e.g., source code, text) for the purposes of completing an
				assignment or the final project. Also, students are forbidden from
				collaborating on any assignment except were explicitly
				allowed in writing by the instructor.

				for all students that is free from all forms of discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, 
				national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is a violation of state and federal law and/or 
				NC State University policy and will not be tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the form of quid pro quo or 
				creation of a hostile environment) based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, 
				veteran status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State University policy 
				and will not be tolerated. Retaliation against any person who complains about discrimination is also prohibited.

					<li>If you test positive for COVID-19, or are told by a healthcare provider that you are presumed positive for the virus,  you should not attend any hybrid or face-to-face (F2F) classes and work with your instructor on any adjustments necessary; also follow other university guidelines, including self-reporting (<a href="https://healthypack.dasa.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/">Coronavirus Self Reporting</a>):  Self-reporting is not only to help provide support to you, but also to assist in contact tracing for containing the spread of the virus.</li>

					<li>If you feel unwell, even if you have not been knowingly exposed to COVID-19, please do not come to a F2F class or activity.</li>

					<li>If you are in quarantine, have been notified that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, or have a personal or family situation related to COVID-19 that prevents you from attending this course in person (or synchronously), please connect with your instructor to make alternative plans, as necessary. </li>
