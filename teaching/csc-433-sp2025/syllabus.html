			<h3 id="communications-policy">Communication Guidelines</h3>

				<h4>Respecting our learning community</h4>

				<p>The <a href="https://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01/">NC State Code of Student Conduct</a> outlines expectations for behavior in the classroom (whether virtual or physical) and the consequences for students who violate these expectations. Any behavior that impacts other students’ ability to learn and succeed will be addressed, but expressing diverse viewpoints and interpretations of course content is welcome.</p>

				<p>Community guidelines for this course include:</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Use a respectful tone in all forms of communication (email, written, oral, visual)</li>
						<li>Maintain professionalism (avoid slang, poor grammar, etc.) in your written communication</li>
						<li>Respect regional dialects and culturally embedded ways of oral communication</li>
						<li>Stay home or in your dorm room if you are exhibiting symptoms of a contagious illness (fever, chills, etc.)</li>
						<li>Enter our virtual and/or physical classroom community respectfully by refraining from lewd or indecent speech or behavior, helping to maintain a safe physical environment, not using your cell phone for voice or text communication except when explicitly given leave to do so, and not attending class under the influence of any substance</li>
						<li>Treat each community member with respect by not recording others without their consent or engaging in any form of hazing, harassment, intimidation, or abuse</li>
						<li>Respect cultural differences that may influence communication styles and needs</li>
				</ul>

				<!--<<p>Announcements and online class discussion will occur via <a href="https://piazza.com/ncsu/fall2024/csc533/home">Piazza</a>. 
				It is the responsibility of the student to sign up for an account. Questions to the instructor or TA should occur in Piazza unless
				there is a reason not to. The instructor or the TA will do their best to respond to questions in Piazza within 24 hours. When appropriate, make the
				question viewable to everyone so that the answer can benefit all students. For sensitive matters (e.g., grading), email the instructor and/or TA. Whenever
				emailing the TA about grading concerns, please CC the instructor.</p>


				p>Students should be aware that their behavior impacts other people, even online. I hope that we will all strive to develop a positive and supportive environment and will be courteous to fellow students and your instructor. Due to the nature of the online environment, there are some things to remember when taking an online course and engaging with others. </p>

				Tips for Success:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Do:</strong> Follow the same standards of behavior that you subscribe to offline.  Keep in mind that all online communication is documented and therefore permanent. </li>

					<li><strong>Don't</strong>: Flame others in discussion forums. Flaming is the act of responding in a highly critical, sarcastic, or ridiculing manner – especially if done on a personal level.  Remember that these discussions are meant for constructive exchanges and learning!</li>
				 
					<li><strong>Do</strong>: Ensure you are responding to forums by the due date, in order to leave time for peers to comment on your response. </li>

					<li><strong>Don't</strong>: Go for long periods of time without communicating to your instructors or classmates. It is important to stay a part of the online community!</li>
				 
					<li><strong>Do</strong>:  Remember to read over your posts before selecting "Submit."</li>

					<li><strong>Don't</strong>: Use slang, poor grammar, and other informal language in discussion forums or email messages to instructors or classmates.</li>
				</ul>-->


				<h4>Plan for interaction between instructors and students</h4>
				
				<p>Course related announcements and online class discussion will occur via <a href="https://piazza.com/ncsu/spring2025/csc433/home">Piazza</a>. 
				It is the responsibility of the student to sign up for an account. Questions to the instructor or TA should occur in Piazza unless
				there is a reason not to. The instructor or the TA will do their best to respond to questions in Piazza within one business day. When appropriate, make the
				question viewable to everyone so that the answer can benefit all students. For sensitive matters (e.g., grading), email the instructor and/or TA. Whenever
				emailing the TA about grading concerns, please CC the instructor.</p>

				<p> The instructor will meet with each project group over Zoom to assess their progress and provide advice midway through the semester.</p>
				

				<h4>Expectations for learner participation and interaction</h4>

				<p>Some course activities include Moodle quizzes which students need to complete in class. Some lectures will involve synchronous group work that will require you to interact with other students in the course. Most classes will involve student discussions where students are expected to engage with the instructor.</p>

				<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete 
				grade will automatically change to an 'F' after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which 
				the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student 
				is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to 'F' will count as an attempted course 
				on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. 
				The university policy on incomplete grades is located at <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3</a>.
