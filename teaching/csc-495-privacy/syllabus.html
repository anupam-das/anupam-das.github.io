			<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>	
			
				<p>Privacy is a growing concern in our modern society. We interact and share our personal information with a wide variety of organizations, including financial and healthcare institutions, web service providers and social networks. Many times such personal information is inappropriately collected, used or shared, often without our awareness. This course introduces privacy in a broad sense, with the aim of providing students an overview of the challenging and emerging research topics in privacy.<p> 

				<p>This course will expose students to many of the issues that privacy engineers, program managers, researchers and designers deal with in industry. By the end of the course, students will learn about the following areas in privacy:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Privacy fundamentals: an overview of privacy definitions and history.</li>
					<li>Data privacy: the motivations for data privacy and common implementations (e.g., k-anonymity, differential privacy, information flow).</li> 
					<li>Web/online privacy: online tracking, usable privacy, anonymous communication and privacy policies.</li>
					<li>Emerging topics: privacy in IoT, AI for privacy, privacy enhancing technologies.</li>
				</ul>
				
			<h2>Textbooks and Reading Material</h2>

				<p>
				This course has no formal textbook. The course readings will come from online
				book chapters, seminal papers, and other informative sources.
				</p>

				<p>
				Here are some useful online books that provide additional information:
				</p>
				<ul>

				</ul>
				
				
			<h2 id="student-learning-outcomes">Student Learning Outcomes</h2>

				<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Learn different definitions of privacy</li>
					<li>Understand personally identifiable information (PII) in databases and techniques to anonymize and protect such information</li>
					<li>Understand various online tracking mechanisms and ways to mitigate such pervasive tracking</li>
					<li>Explain how anonymous communication networks work and how they can help users preserve their online anonymity</li>
					<li>Identify and describe important elements of privacy policies and regulations</li>

				</ul>

			<h3 id="course-structure">Course Structure and Grading</h3>

				<p>The course will consist of one midterm, one final, five home assignments (best four will be considered), a class project (groups of 2-3 maybe allowed based on the particular project selected) and class participation (through discussions) that contribute the the final grade in the following propotions:</p>

				<table>
				  <tbody>
					<tr>
					  <td>20%</td>
					  <td>Homework Assignments</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>20%</td>
					  <td>Midterm Exam</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>20%</td>
					  <td>Final Exam</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>30%</td>
					  <td>Class Project</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
					  <td>10%</td>
					  <td>Class Participation</td>
					</tr>
				  </tbody>
				</table>

				<p>The final letter grade will be based on the final percentage as follows:</p>

				<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">
				A+ &lt;= 97% &lt; A &lt;= 93% &lt; A- &lt;= 90% &lt;
				B+ &lt;= 87% &lt; B &lt;= 83% &lt; B- &lt;= 80% &lt;
				C+ &lt;= 77% &lt; C &lt;= 73% &lt; C- &lt;= 70% &lt;
				D+ &lt;= 67% &lt; D &lt;= 63% &lt; D- &lt;= 60% &lt; F
				</p>

				<p>REG 02.50.03 (<a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-03">Grades and
					Grade Point Average</a>) describes the grade point interpretation of
				letter grades.</p>
			
			<h4 id="homework-assignments">Homework Assignments</h4>
				<p>The instructor will assign homework assignments on a
				periodic basis for topics associated with the class assignments. These
				homeworks require the students to write, program, or perform other basic
				research. The content and due dates of these assignments will be decided over
				the course of the semester. If you cannot attend a lecture, contact other
				students to see if any assignments have been made and consult the syllabus.</p>
			
			<h4 id="class-project">Class Project</h4>
				<p>The class project will require students to conduct researches relate to the course material.
				Students may opt to work solely or in groups of two or three depending on the scope of the project.
				Students can suggest their own projects or choose one from <a href="projects.html">here</a>.
				High quality results will potentially lead to conference papers.</p>

			<h4 id="class-participation">Class Participation</h4>
				<p>To do well in this course, students must take active and regular roles in discussion and demonstrate comprehension of the reading and lecture themes. 
				Students are required to do the assigned reading before class. This will be closely monitored by the instructor, thereby making a student's ability to demonstrate their comprehension of papers essential to a receiving a passing grade.</p>
				
			<h2 id="incomplete-policy">Policies on Incomplete Grades</h2>
				<p>If an extended deadline is not authorized by the instructor or department, an unfinished incomplete 
				grade will automatically change to an F after either (a) the end of the next regular semester in which 
				the student is enrolled (not including summer sessions), or (b) the end of 12 months if the student 
				is not enrolled, whichever is shorter. Incompletes that change to F will count as an attempted course 
				on transcripts. The burden of fulfilling an incomplete grade is the responsibility of the student. 
				The university policy on incomplete grades is located at <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-50-3</a>.	
			
			<h2 id="weekly-course-schedule">Weekly Course Schedule</h2>

				<p>See the course <a href="/teaching/csc-495-privacy/schedule.html">schedule</a>. Note that
				the schedule is subject to change as the semester evolves.</p>	
							
			<h2 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h2>
				<p>No late assignments will be accepted. Students with legitimate reasons who contact the professor before the deadline may apply for an extension.</p>
		
			<h2 id="communications-policy">Communications Policy</h2>

				<p>Announcements and online class discussion will occur via <a href="https://piazza.com/ncsu/spring2019/csc495591/">Piazza</a>. 
				It is the responsibility of the student to sign up
				for an account. Questions to the instructor or TA should occur in Piazza unless
				there is a reason not to. The instructor or the TA will do their best to
				respond to questions in Piazza within 24 hours. When appropriate, make the
				question viewable to everyone so that the answer can benefit all students. For
				sensitive matters (e.g., grading), email the instructor and/or TA. Whenever
				emailing the TA about grading concerns, please CC the instructor.</p>
				
				
			<h2 id="electronically-hosted-course-components">Electronically-Hosted Course Components</h2>
			
				<p>Students may be required to disclose personally identifiable information to other students in the course, via electronic tools like email or web-postings, where relevant to the course. 
				Examples include online discussions of class topics, and posting of student coursework. 
				All students are expected to respect the privacy of each other by not sharing or using such information outside the course.</p>
		
		
			<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>

				<p>The instructor will not take any formal attendance for class meetings.
				However, as stated above, a portion of the grade is based on class participation, which includes active participation in class discussions. 
				Additionally, exam material includes anything in the readings, slides, and topics discussed in
				class. Students missing class should consult classmates on missed
				material.</p>

				<p>The university policy on excused absences will be observed (see <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03">http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-03</a>).
				The students are responsible for discussing makeup exams if they miss
				exams due to excused absence. The instructor will choose a mutually
				agreed date and time for the makeup exam. Late submission of homework
				assignments due to excused absences is not subject to the policies on
				late assignments.</p>

			<h2 id="academic-integrity-policy">Academic Integrity Policy</h2>

				<p>
				The university, college, and department policies against academic
				dishonesty will be strictly enforced. You may obtain copies of the NCSU
				Code of Student Conduct from the Office of Student Conduct, or from the
				following URL: <a href="http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01">http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-01</a>
				</p>

				<p>
				The instructor expects honesty in the completion of test and
				assignments. The instructor has a zero tolerance policy for violations
				of academic integrity. The instructor carefully monitors for instances
				of offenses such as plagiarism and illegal collaboration, so it is very
				important that students use their best possible judgement in meeting
				this policy. The instructor will not entertain any discussion on the
				discovery of an offense, and will assign the 'F' grade and refer the
				student to the appropriate University bodies for possible further
				action. It is the understanding and expectation of instructor that
				the student's signature on any test or assignment means that the student
				neither gave nor received unauthorized aid.
				For additional information, visit <a href="http://studentconduct.ncsu.edu/">http://studentconduct.ncsu.edu/</a>
				</p>

				<p>Note that students are explicitly forbidden to copy anything off the
				Internet (e.g., source code, text) for the purposes of completing an
				assignment or the final project. Also, students are forbidden from
				discussing or collaborating on any assignment except were explicitly
				allowed in writing by the instructor.
