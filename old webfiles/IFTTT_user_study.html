<h3 id="description">Project Description</h3>

<p>
We are conducting a user study to understand users’ habits and attitudes towards creating or using IFTTT applets. More specifically, we want to understand how users choose applets and whether they think about certain side-effects when using or creating applets. This study is being lead by <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~lbauer/">Lujo Bauer</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.
</p> 

<p>
In order for us to conduct this study we require information about real applets that users use. For this we ask participants to log into their IFTTT account and provide us (via an extension that participants are asked to install) with the list of applets they use. Following that, we ask some general questions about participants’ IFTTT usage and then more detailed questions about specific applets (we ask questions for at most 10 applets).
</p>

<div class="question" id="q-needtodo">What do I need to do to participate?</div>

<div class="answer">First, you need to have an IFTTT account with at least three applets. You then need to browse the link specified above from a Chrome browser. In order to automate the task of retrieving applets and asking you questions about your specific applets, you will be asked to download a Chrome extension (published on the webstore). Finally, to qualify for participation you will need to be a resident of US and be at least 18 years old.</div>

<div class="question" id="q-howlong">How long will it take to finish the survey?</div>

<div class="answer">It will take you around 20 minutes to finish.</div>

<div class="question" id="q-personaldata">Will any personal data be collected?</div>

<div class="answer">No personal information is collected. However, IFTTT usernames will be collected to ensure no one takes the survey multiple times, but they will not be used in the analysis or released with the results.</div>

<div class="question" id="q-reward">Will I be rewarded for participation?</div>

<div class="answer">You get $5 Amazon gift card for you participation. You are also entered into a $50 Amazon gift card raffle where there will be at least one winner chosen for every 10 respondents. In order to receive gift cards you must submit your email address so that we can send out the gift card code.</div>
