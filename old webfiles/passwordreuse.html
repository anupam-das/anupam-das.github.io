<h3 id="description">Project Description</h3>
The objective of this project was to analysis the impact of password reuse across different web accounts. For this purpose
we gathered several leaked password data set and looked at the similarity of passwords used by individual users. For
privacy reasons we used hashed email accounts to uniquely identify users. From our data set we found that around 43% of 
the users were using exactly the same passwords across different websites while 19% of the users used slightly modified 
version of existing passwords. We then looked at the transformation rules used by the users. 
<p>
We also conducted a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xSfwtaUObuTdr4ec1q8SY6-w0mrHjO1KxR7eyFxDnGw">survey</a> regarding password reuse. The survey responses are summarized <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xSfwtaUObuTdr4ec1q8SY6-w0mrHjO1KxR7eyFxDnGw/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics"> here </a>. The survey responses conveyed results similar to
what we found from the leaked data set.
 
<p>
We next developed the first cross-site password guessing algorithm, which is able to guess 30% of the transformed passwords within 100 attempts (10% of the transformed passwords were correctly guessed within 10 attempts) compared to just 14% for a guessing algorithm (using standard password cracking libraries) without cross-site password knowledge. This implies a real security threat as an attacker with a leaked, nonidentical password can mount an online guessing attack with orders of magnitude higher success than an attacker without a leaked password.
