<h1>Collecting Sensor Data from Smart Devices</h1>
<a href="#description">Project Description</a> | <a href="#participate">How to participate</a>| <a href="#faq">FAQ</a></center>

<h3 id="description">Project Description</h3>

<p>The object of this project is to gather sensor data like accelerometer and gyroscope readings&nbsp;from smart devices under different conditions. We plan to analyze the collected&nbsp;data to characterize the sensors embedded in different&nbsp;devices&nbsp;from a security and privacy point of view.&nbsp;Your participation is voluntary and fully anonymous, we therefore, request participants to participate sincerely. Although your participation in this research may not benefit you personally right&nbsp;now, it will help us understand to what degree users might be vulnerable to website fingerprinting and thus&nbsp;help us create public awareness.</p>

<p>To gather sensor data from smart devices we have developed a <a href="http://datarepo.cs.illinois.edu/DataCollectionHowPlaced.html">web page</a>. So, participants only need to visit the web page and do not need to install any&nbsp;apps.</p>

<p>We are careful in not violating user privacy and are therefore not tracking any personal data. Our project went through IRB review&nbsp;and since we are not collecting any personal data of users IRB office has confirmed that we do not require any IRB approval. The official IRB letter is available <a href="./14436_NHSR_01162014.pdf">here </a>.</p>

<p>This experiment is&nbsp;leaded by&nbsp;<a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~adas8/">Anupam Das</a>, a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&nbsp;This project is being supervised by Professor <a href="http://hatswitch.org/~nikita/"> Nikita Borisov</a> (Hatswitch Group) and Professor <a href="http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~caesar/">Matt Caesar</a>&nbsp;from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:das17@illinois.edu?subject=Smartphone%20Project">contact us</a> with any question or suggestion.</p>

<h3 id="participate">How to participate</h3>

<p>Participants need to fulfill two requirements:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Use a smartphone or tablet (preferably a smartphone).</li>
	<li>Use the<strong> latest version</strong> of one of the&nbsp;following browsers- Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Safari.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">To participate please click the following link</span></strong></span>: <a href="http://datarepo.cs.illinois.edu/DataCollectionHowPlaced.html">Our data collection&nbsp;web page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A description of the different components of the webpage is give in the <a href="#q-whatarethebuttons">FAQ section</a>.</p>

<p>To participate a user has to browse through our web pages in the following manner:</p>

<div class="inlineBlock">
<ul>
	<li>First, participants are asked where they have placed their phone (<strong><em>we are mainly interested on either placing the smart device on a flat table or in hand</em></strong>). By &quot;in hand&quot; we mean the user is sitting on a chair or couch and <strong>not moving</strong> his/her hand too much. Depending on the scenario the user should select the appropriate button.</li>
</ul>
<img align="absbottom" alt="screen1" src="images/Screenshot2.png" style="width: 200px; margin-left: 100px;" />
<ul>
	<li>Next, the user should select one of two possible settings under which data is to be collected.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="screen2" src="images/Screenshot1.png" style="margin-left: 100px; width: 200px; vertical-align: bottom;" />
<ul>
	<li>Lastly, the user should press the &quot;Start/Resume&quot; button to start the data collection process (if any of the audio setting is selected then&nbsp;data will be collected while the audio stream is being played in the background). Each sample requires ~9 seconds and we collect 10 samples per setting. So, each setting would require ~1.5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="screen3" src="images/Screenshot3.png" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; width: 200px;" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<p>There are a total of 4&nbsp;(2*2) possible settings under which samples can be taken (i.e., 2 position of smart device and 2&nbsp;settings). We appreciate participants to provide as much data as possible.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="faq">FAQ (Frequently Anticipated Questions)</h3>

</ol>

<div class="question" id="q-whatarethebuttons">What do the buttons&nbsp;on the web pages do?</div>

<div class="answer">
<ol>
	<li>First web page: Select how the phone is placed for the data collection session.
	<ul>
		<li>On Desk: On top of a flat table or surface.</li>
		<li>In Hand: In the hand of the user while the user&nbsp;is not moving about too much (like browsing a web page while sitting a chair or couch).</li>
		<li>Go to instruction page: Forwards the user to this page.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>The second web page: Provides options for selecting an&nbsp;experimental setting.
	<ul>
		<li>Raw Data Collection: Simply collects raw sensor readings. Provides us with base line measurement.</li>
		<li>Play Sine Wave (20 kHz): Plays a pure 20 kHz Sine wave while collecting sensor readings.</li>
		<li>Go to instruction page: Forwards the user to this page.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>The third web page: Provide options for starting and&nbsp;pausing the data collection process under the selected setting.
	<ul>
		<li>Start/Resume: Starts the data collection process. Also starts playing any audio file or vibrating the phone if such a setting was selected.</li>
		<li>Stop/Pause: Pauses the data collection process. Also stops playing any audio file or vibrating the phone if such a setting was selected..</li>
		<li>Select New setting: Takes the user back to the first web page so that the user can select a different experimental setting. However, if the user starts a data collection session then the user is requested to finish 10 samples before going back to the main page.</li>
		<li>Go to instruction page: Forwards the user to this page.</li>
	</ul>
	Note: Once you press the Start/Resume button it becomes disabled, similarly once you press the Stop/Pause button it becomes disabled. However, at any given point both buttons are never disabled.</li>
</ol>

<p>At any given point the user could refresh the webpage, however, this will remove any previously stored states like the number of samples already taken out of 10. Also users can just go back to the previous pages to select new setting.</p>
</div>

<div class="question" id="q-howlong">How long will this take?</div>

<div class="answer">Each sample takes about ~9&nbsp;seconds. So, for a given setting 10 samples would require ~1.5 minutes. For all possible settings it would require a total of ~6&nbsp;minutes.</div>

<div class="question" id="q-privelegsrequired">What kind of browser and OS versions are supported?</div>

<div class="answer">Our data collection process requires participants to use one of the following browsers-
<ol>
	<li>Chrome&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Opera</li>
	<li>Firefox (though you may run to some issues in Firefox)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Safari</li>
</ol>
The default <em>Android Browser</em> will not provide all the APIs that we need, we therefore, ask participants to install one of the above browsers.<br />
Also for any Android device the OS version should be &gt;=4.0 and for any Apple product it should be at least iOS 4.0.</div>

<div class="question" id="q-bwrequired">How much bandwidth is used for uploading data?</div>

<div class="answer">Each sample file is about 60-100 KBs in size. So, 10 samples would upload a maximum of 1 MB. And all possible combination would require at most 8 MBs of upload.</div>

<div class="question" id="q-whereisdatastored">Where is the data stored?</div>

<div class="answer">Sensor readings are sent out to the following server- <a href="http://datarepo.cs.illinois.edu">datarepo.cs.illinois.edu</a> situated inside the UoI campus. We plan to make the data public to other researchers in future.</div>

<div class="question" id="q-whatsmeasured">What is being measured and why?</div>

<div class="answer">We are measuring the sensor values under different settings. We hope to the analyze the sensor data to uniquely characterize different sensors. Such characterization would be useful from both security (are you using the right device) and privacy (what information is being leaked) point of view.</div>
