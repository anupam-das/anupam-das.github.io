I conduct research in different aspects of security and privacy with a special focus towards designing secure and privacy-preserving technologies. My research takes a data-driven approach by collecting large volumes of data from different real-world settings to discover and analyze emerging security and privacy threats. More information about my research can be found <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~adas8/#interests">here</a>.

I'm looking for motivated and energetic students to work together on problems in security, privacy, human-computer interaction (HCI) and ubiquitous computing. Candidates are expected to have a strong background in Computer Science. Prior experience in security or privacy is not mandatory. However, candidates should be eager to learn and explore new things. Experience in other areas including machine learning, systems, signal processing, ubiquitous computing and theory is also a plus. If you are interested, you can <a href="mailto:anupam009@gmail.com?subject=Interested in your research">Email</a> me.
